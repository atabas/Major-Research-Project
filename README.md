Folder structure is as follows:
Mass-Full-Images_CBIS-DDSM > Test (for test images from Mass-Test Full Mammogram Images) and Mass-Full-Images_CBIS-DDSM > Training (for test images from Mass-Training Full Mammogram Images)
Mass-Test-Description (csv) and Mass-Training-Description (csv) also need to be in the parent folder (Mass-Full-Images_CBIS-DDSM)
